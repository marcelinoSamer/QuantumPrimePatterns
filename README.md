# QuantumProject
This project aims to find the probability of finding a Prime number inside a given set of numebrs. This helps in understanding the pattern of quantum numbers in Mathematics and caluclus, demonstrating Riemann's conjecture.

The code will consist of 3 code blocks. The first, generates a random 8-Qubit number, using the random number generator algorithm. The second code block transforms this binary number into a decimal number using binary conversion and storing it in a variable. The third and final code block saves this number in a list. These steps are done iterativly N number of times (specified by the user). After the main program loops till end, the final lines execute a ration between the number of prime numbers inside the list and the total size of the list finding the ratio of prime numbers in this set of numbers.

Notes:
We needed a virtual environment to be able to test the code locally due to issues with the Aer module. As the virtual environment was very inefficient in space complexity we decided to not include it in the final submission.
