# QuantumProject
This project aims to find the probability of finding a Prime number inside a given set of numebrs. This helps in understanding the pattern of quantum numbers in Mathematics and caluclus, demonstrating Riemann's conjecture.

The code will consist of 3 code blocks. The first, generates a random 8-Qubit number, using the random number generator algorithm. The second code block transforms this binary number into a decimal number using binary conversion and storing it in a variable. The third and final code block saves this number in a list. These steps are done iterativly N number of times (specified by the user). After the main program loops till end, the final lines execute a ration between the number of prime numbers inside the list and the total size of the list finding the ratio of prime numbers in this set of numbers.
